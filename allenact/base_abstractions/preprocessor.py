    Allows for the construction of observations that are a function of
    sensor readings. For instance, perhaps rather than giving your agent
    a raw RGB image, you'd rather first pass that image through a pre-trained
    convolutional network and only give your agent the resulting features
    (see e.g. the `ResNetPreprocessor` class).

    preprocessors : List containing preprocessors with required input uuids, output uuid of each
        sensor must be unique.
    observation_spaces: The observation spaces of the values returned when calling `get_observations`.
        By default (see the `additionally_exposed_uuids` parameter to to change this default) the observations
        returned by the `SensorPreprocessorGraph` **include only the sink nodes** of the graph (i.e.
        those that are not used by any other preprocessor).
